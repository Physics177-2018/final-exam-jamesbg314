If its a more efficient solution, do it, if its a less efficient solution, take a dice roll dependent on the \"tempurature\" which lowers as more changes are made, until it gets below a preset temp.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Doing this will generate an efficient solution to a problem. A classic example would be the traveling salesperson, where you want to take a set of cities with different distances between and find a good path between them, for many cities testing all of the microstates would take far too long for all the permutations that exist, so instead you use the MCMC to generate a pretty decent approximation of the preferred path.*"
